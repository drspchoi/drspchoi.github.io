## I. Definition
# Project Overview

Biochar is a porous carbon-rich material produced from biomass-waste such as agricultural waste, wood waste or food waste through a thermochemical process like gasification or pyrolysis[1]. 
Biochar has potential applications in waste-water treatment, catalysts, electrodes, carbon sequestration agents, soil amendment agents and solid fuels[2]. 

To design and produce the biochar for the specific application is highly dependent on the physicochemical properties of the biochar[1]. 
The process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, time) and intrinsic properties of biomass (e.g., element composition) affect the 
properties of the biochar[2]. Therefore, the accurate prediction of the properties of the biochar produced from the different process conditions and biomass waste will be helpful 
for the investigation of the potential application of biochar.
